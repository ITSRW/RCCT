# Rossler-s-Whisper
The RCCT is a hybrid encryption system designed by improving Rossler chaotic system and combining with asymmetric encryption. The RCCT encryption algorithm has high reliability and security, and is very sensitive to the one millionth accuracy of the key fine-tuning, and has good robustness in the face of the transmission process noise.It can be used to secure the information transmission under speech surveillance, the main encrypt/decrypt contents can be texts, pictures or audio/video files and other big files.
After you download the RCCT_V1.0.rar,Environmentpack01.rar & Environmentpack02.rar, you must release Environmentpack01.rar and Environmentpack02.rar in a new folder named "Environment"; and make sure the "Environment" folder is under the same catalog with what you released from RCCT_V1.0, otherwise the RCCT.EXE will not be able to work.
You may read the "help.pdf"  learning how to use this system, and you will have to make sure your communicate objects are also using RCCT if you want to send/recieve encrypted messages.
